What is the status of your project?

    JC: Part 1 is working

What has each team done to ensure the success of the team?

    JH: so far, Joe has set up another branch for part 1 & whats in progress/ not fully functional
    yet, and as he said, we have set up a few channels of communication

    JC: We have set up multiple ways to communicate

What can each team member do going forward to ensure the success of the team?

    JH: we both think the best course forward is to
             a) complete the assignment
             b) coordinate to prevent duplication of work

    JC: Make sure we have a plan of what each person will do for each part
